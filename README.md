# WallMap

Project Name: The Digital Wall Map

Application Description: Much like a map you would have pinned up on a wall, I am able to place pins on locations I would like to go one day and visualize the resulting map.

Features + Tools/Technologies: Using the Google Maps API, a map is available that allows its user to place pins anywhere they want on a map and stores them for future reference.

Timeline: Working on my own, I hope to finish the general interface of the website before class on the 24th and the Google Maps part of the website during and after class, before May 1st.
